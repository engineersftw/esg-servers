Abstract:
Like many developers, we had to deal with a back-end written in Ruby 1.8 and we discovered the awesomeness of Serverless. Migrating entire back-end at once is not a piece of cake but the capabilities of Serverless computing allowed us to migrate back-end from Ruby to AWS Lambda functions. We encountered lot of pitfalls along the journey and in this session I am planning to share my experiences on migrating legacy back-ends to Serverless and how to plan parallel migrations avoiding long waiting release cycles.
