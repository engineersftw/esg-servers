The FOSS and Linux community fascinated me since I was 12 years of age, Ever since then I follow the strategy of “Every Software is better when it’s free”. I have seen many areas of the tech grow rapidly when they started promoting the FOSS culture. With my experience at developing the SUSI Smart Speaker, Linux Scripting and talk experience at JugaadFest’2018, I assure to deliver the best of my experiences until now to introduce on how promoting Open Source in the Smart Speaker industry will lead to a boom in the Smart Speaker industry and how we have used the FOSS technologies to make it one of the coolest Smart Speaker yet.</p>",

Michlmayr completed a doctorate in technology management at the University of Cambridge in 2007. The focus of this research was on quality improvement in free software and open source projects, and particularly on release management processes and practices. In 2013, O'Reilly awarded an open source award to Michlmayr, putting him in \"the 'unsung heroes' category—the people who devote themselves to the important but not always glorious jobs that keep open source healthy\". Between 2008 and 2014 Michlmayr served on the board of directors of the Open Source Initiative, acting as the organization's secretary.</p>",
