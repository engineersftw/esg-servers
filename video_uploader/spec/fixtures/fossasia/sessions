It provides all of the features a user would need in an image/gallery application. It provides an option to click images using a fully functional camera which comes in with all the features like Burst mode, ISO management, and so on.

We have made Phimpme in such a way that the user does not require to install any other application other than the Phimpme app for handling and sharing their images on multiple platforms all at once. And with the Compress image feature added in Phimpme, users don't need to have any other application installed for the purpose of compressing pictures. </span></p><p><span style=\"\">Some of the other interesting features I would love to talk about have been jotted down below:</span></p><p>1.

Now the time has come to deploy your app so that it can be publicly available and can be used by users. you choose digital ocean to deploy your app and after struggling to install requirements, configuring your server and now your app finally deployed. Now you slept as you are tired as you worked day and night to convert your dream idea to the product. In the morning, you woke up and you see countless emails as your app hit the market and your server couldn’t handle those requests so it crashed. you added more server to the fleet and sent apology mail to your existing customers, and stating that your app is back in service.</p><p style=\"\">A month later you got one email from digital ocean to pay the amount, it cost you a total of 5000$ but your app is only used by the customer in the first week and you calculated and it should cost 1500$ but the bill is 5000$. why there is a difference of 3500$ ? you now checked, and all those servers you added, cost you that much amount, they were running 24*7. Here if you used serverless than it only costs you 1500$.</p><p style=\"\">In this talk, we will see how can you use serverless to build serverless compliant apps. For the sake of example we will build serverless bots, nowadays Bot is serving to help people with their required information. You do not need an expensive internet connection to talk to the bot, but you need an expensive server to run your bot but not with the case with the serverless.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>Benefits of serverless</strong> <strong>No Administration</strong> - We can deploy our code without provisioning anything beforehand, or manage anything afterward. There is no concept of a fleet, an instance, or even an operating system.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>Scalability</strong> - One doesn’t have to care about auto-scaling, No need to show alerts or write scripts to scale up and down. With serverless, we can handle quick bursts of traffic.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>Cost</strong> - Function-as-a-service (FaaS) compute and managed services charged based on actual usage rather than pre-provisioned capacity. This means one pay the amount we use, so if we use service for 10 sec then we pay for 10 sec.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>Faster Development</strong> - Now loop between having an idea and deploying to production is shortened because no one need to manage anything after deployment, smaller teams can ship more features. It’s easier than ever to make your idea live.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>Easy Integration</strong> - With Other Services Going serverless allows a seamless integration to various other cloud services from the same provider. For example, if you are using the AWS platform for chatbots, then you can use DynamoDB for the database, write programming logic as Lambda functions, and expose them through the API Gateway.</p>Session key Takeaways<p style=\"\">The main question is how to write code which is serverless compliant. This is where this session will help you. This talk will help people to move a step ahead of the traditional way of writing code as some of you had already developed chatbot, I will share how can you think (a serverless way) and write the simple chatbot in python and can take leverage of serverless to deploy and publish. I will cover:</p><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Serverless Framework principals</li><li style=\"\">AWS Lambda and API Gateway</li><li style=\"\">How to write a chatbot in python and create a Lambda function</li><li style=\"\">How to troubleshoot in a serverless world</li></ul>",

The notion sociotechnical design practices, for\nexample, stands for tight entanglements and co-shaping processes of\ntechnical and social elements. Following this basic assumption\ncritical algorithm studies, infrastructure studies, and software\nstudies have started to investigate how social biases in big data,\npreferences of designers and coders, or imaginations of future users\nshape digital tools, software, or artificial intelligence. Moreover,\ninnovative methods have been developed to not only analyze, but also\nproblematize and intervene in software practices. “De-biasing”\nhas become an issue of concern bringing together computer scientists\nand social scientists to learn from each other in the attempt to\nbring fairness, accountability and transparency to the table of\nsoftware design.</span></p>",

We use Flask framework to design a basic webapp named Meilix-Generator for the user to go there and provide their configuration and build their distro. We deploy the webapp on Heroku. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">We took the most common approach to a project which gives a GUI to customize our own Linux Distro with LXQT as a desktop environment, which is implemented first time ever.

With blockchain technology democratizing information distribution, Edge AI bringing intelligence to the end device, chatbots powered by enormous amounts of trained data mimicking human beings and machine learning and deep learning making accurate predictions, it has become possible to ensure the best medical care is provided to every individual irrespective of their place of residence. With all these technologies being open sourced, it is easy to focus on how to improve the efficiency, enhance the security and refine the accuracy while reducing the cost.</p><p>Automated Emergency Paramedical Response System leverages various open source technologies to provide medical supplies using aerial distribution by drones. It is a multifunctional end to end semi-autonomous system which operates differently in urban and rural areas based on their individual requirements. In semi-urban and rural areas, there is a need to provide access to specialised doctors and medical supplies as these are unavailable in their community hospitals. AERPS  leverages medical image processing and deep learning using OpenCV and TensorFlow to accurately predict the presence of disease like ischemic strokes and based on the diagnosis, allows the community hospital to order for medical supplies. The medical supplies are delivered using a drone enhanced with edge AI to run intelligent algorithms enabling it to ensure that the medicines are only delivered to authorised people and providing accurate obstacle avoidance thus making delivery in hard to reach places easier. In congested urban areas, an interactive chatbot with the ability to predict ailments based on patient symptoms informs the medical personnel who approves the delivery of medicines thus providing quick delivery of medical supplies where traffic is a major roadblock in providing medical assistance. Confidentiality of patient records has been achieved by using decentralised blockchain-based distributed computing to ensure security for the users without involving third-party institutions.</p>",

There are valuable insights hidden in this data that ML \ncan help extract with minimal human intervention. Using open source \ntools like TensorFlow and Pandas we trained ML algorithms with real-life\n data from the OpenStack community's CI system. We built a Kubernetes \napplication that sets up a prediction pipeline to automate the analysis \nof CI jobs in near real time. It uses the trained model to classify new \ninputs and predict insights like test results or hosting cloud provider.\n In this talk, we present our experience training different ML models \nwith the large dataset from OpenStack's CI and how this can be leveraged\n for automated failure identification and analysis. We also discuss how \nthese techniques can be used with any CI system.</p>",

Most of the value that the conductor (community manager) brings to the orchestra (community) is carried out before the performance (behind the scenes). In this session, I will share my experiences in orchestras and open source communities big and small across different countries. How do you take care of the different types of contributors/players and bring out their best? What happens when they have differences in opinion on how to collaborate? How do you make the community welcoming and inclusive especially for people with different backgrounds and who may not speak your (programming) language? Join me on a musical journey through some of the common (and perhaps not so common) dissonances of community orchestration and their possible resolutions!</span></p>",

Thus, due to the lack of the system which\nprovides a data log for the patient health record, it is not possible to\nregularly monitor the important parameters such as temperature, pressure, pulse\netc, from a distant place.

Now its above  90% on an average.  So how did we turn this around?</p><p>1. We found out most noshowers are habitual/repeat offenders. We now keep a blacklist -&gt; any no shows are automatically put in this list and are barred from any of our meetups for one year. </p><p>2. Our screening have become stricter: We now ask a potential registrant queries regarding their theme experience[our monthly meetups revolve around a single theme: like either DevOps or Python or Mobility etc] and OSS contributions. This was wholly manual and extremely time consuming. We are now using elements of AI/ML to validate and assign a score. Its a WIP but it is progressively getting more accurate as we accumulate more data. This alone has made for a healthy curated audience.</p><p>3. One reason we are moving to open event is that Eventbrite does not expose an API endpoint for checkins : its only possible via their desktop site or their mobile apps. i.e. only a single organizer can checkin folks. Now we are using Computer Vision to recognize attendees and mark their attendance and checkin them for the various sessions and tracks via the Open Event mobile apps. </p><p>The solution is OSS and the talk + demo will involve:</p><p>Artificial Intelligence ( Algorithms, Cognitive Expert Systems,)</p><p>DevOps (Continuous Delivery, Lean IT, Moving at Cloud-speed)</p><p>Cloud &amp; Microservices (Containers - Libraries, Runtimes, Composition; Kubernetes; Docker, Distributed Services)</p><p>Thank you</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>",

        "short_abstract": "<p> \"Kubernetes\" is one of the most popular and famous container \norchestration open source software. And now, there are so many \nKubernetes environments and deployment tools such as SUSE CaaS Platform,\n minikube, kubeadm, Rancher, GKE/AKS/EKS, etc. So, we can use or build a\n Kubernetes cluster with them very easily. However, it also prevents \nopportunities to understand Kubernetes technologies themselves from \nusers. Therefore, if a Kubernetes cluster gets something wrong, it would\n be tough challenge to resolve it without such knowledge. With the \nsituation, here is a very good exercise document - \"Kubernetes The Hard \nWay[0]\" which is a tutorial for setting up Kubernetes the hard way on \nGoogle Cloud Platform(GCP). People can learn internal architecture of \nKubernetes from that.</p><p> In this session, attendees will get an \nopportunity to know how to set up a Kubernetes cluster on not only GCP \nbut also an OpenStack cloud or something based on the tutorial, and, \nwill get to know its technology deeply.\"Kubernetes The Hard Way\"[0] \nhas 14 chapters right now. And it's written for the GCP basically. \nHowever, it works on the other clouds  with \nsome modifications.</p><p>[0] <a href=\"https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way</a></p>",

Michlmayr completed a doctorate in technology management at the University of Cambridge in 2007. The focus of this research was on quality improvement in free software and open source projects, and particularly on release management processes and practices. In 2013, O'Reilly awarded an open source award to Michlmayr, putting him in \"the 'unsung heroes' category—the people who devote themselves to the important but not always glorious jobs that keep open source healthy\". Between 2008 and 2014 Michlmayr served on the board of directors of the Open Source Initiative, acting as the organization's secretary.</p>",

This is a Blockchain application which is built to address different problem areas with scope to manipulate criminal records such as 'change of data entered in the F.I.R', irregularities due to corruption, lack of transparency , fake test reports to mislead the courts , and police facing difficulty in searching criminals.  In the present scenario F.I.R’s are stored manually, police stick criminal information at public places to create awareness. Test reports are submitted  manually to the judge and police verify the people who check-in in the hotels manually.  This application acts as a single source of truth for all the above mentioned problem areas. The F.I.R s and criminals data are registered into Blockchain application and this database is shared with the hotels and public transport systems to verify the people who check-in or travel. Now-a-days, the DNA or any sort of test reports that are to be submitted in the courts are manipulated.  To prevent this from happening, the application allows the judge to access the medical test reports directly, eliminating the middle men which reduces the scope of manipulation to a maximum extent.  Currently we considered six stake holders namely police, courts, C.I.D, diagnostic centers, hospitals and hotels. The application imbibes high level of security standards , hence issues related to manipulation of records can be eliminated to a maximum extent. As the details of the application are  transparent and accessible , the public will be aware of criminal proceedings. This application is bound to instill confidence in public on the legal proceedings. Fairness in transactions is thus ensured boosting in the economy in long run.</p>",

The survey/poll in these applications can be posted by famous public figures in order to reach a wider audience. This platform offers relevant packages that can be utilized to create appropriate polling applications by the developers. The methodology provided by the platform is transparent to the public and it cannot be modified. And any modifications made to it will have an audit trail which will be visible. This platform can be utilized in number of ways. It can be used widely at the time of elections. It can also be used to gather public opinions on various government decisions. </p><p>   Blockchain is well known for the four main features, namely immutability, transparency, provenance, and being the single source of truth. Our platform supports all the four features. Polls/surveys conducted in traditional methods can be manipulated to favor certain sections, but polling applications created by using the Blockchain Technology will not have scope for manipulation. Hence it is immutable. This platform provides transparency offering visibility of poll outcomes to every one. The history of the surveys/poll are available in the platform, the data can only be appended but not updated, in tandem with the provenance feature. Finally the platform supports the  feature of being the single source of truth. Hence it can also be used as legally acceptable source. In short It's expected to be a game changer.</p>",

This intervention comes at a time when divisive behaviours such as hate speech, fake news, ethnic and religious uprisings etc. are rife around the country. </p><p>The programme is designed to run for 2 years, with each geo-political zone in Nigeria hosting an event at least once. Expected outputs from the Series will include: Open Source Hardware/Software products; documentary film of the series, highlighting collaboration between Nigerian youth, irrespective of ethnic, religious, political or social backgrounds and affiliations; established networks across communities - geographical and ideological.</p><p><b>Methodology for the National Hackathon Series</b></p><p>The hackathon participants are grouped in teams to tinker, design, develop and document technology solutions to problems within their communities using the SDG goals as a guide for identifying problems. This hackathon is not a competition but a collaboration. There are no prizes won! The participants are solution driven for their communities.</p><p>The hackathons also feature interactive dialogue sessions where participants will gain practical insight into peaceful co-existence, from a high-level panel of religious and traditional leaders, media practitioners, representatives of the academia and the organised private sector.</p><p>Our strategy is to use technology and entertainment [embedding unconference sessions to show documentary films that teach good values to participants] as an enabler for national cohesion and integration and in the process induce civic participation.</p><p>After each hackathon, the new participants join the general makers' community of other participants who have attended previous hackathons. </p><p><b>Expected Output of Session</b></p><p>A panel discussion to; </p><ul><li>report the National Hackathon Series held in Nigeria and its role in technology inclusion for global peace advocacy.</li><li>discuss the effect of social media fake news and hate speech on global community conflicts. </li></ul><p></p><p><b>Links</b></p><p><a href=\"https://vilsquare.org/makershub\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://vilsquare.org/makershub</a><b></b></p><p></p>",

So, every user expects to have great performance, smooth animations, and beautiful interactive designs whenever they use a mobile application. also, most of the mobile application developers need to develop such applications and new features without compromising quality or performance. This is where flutter and its interesting features make us have serious look at it.<p>\n\n</p>Flutter is Google's mobile UI framework which provides a fast and expressive way for developers to build native apps on <b>both IOS and Android.</b> Rather than just giving an introduction to flutter, I thought of covering a comparison between flutter and native application development to highlight the key points why flutter has become an all-rounder in terms of <b>flexibility,</b> <b>easiness,</b> and <b>developer-friendliness</b>.  This speech and the demo will focus on following areas such as <b>Flutter’s cool features bundle for developers</b>, <b>Dart the language of flutter </b>and<b> flutter’s reactiveness</b> and <b>why everything in flutter based on widgets</b>. Also during the demo, I am planning to build an application to make sure that the audience is grabbing every cool feature to have a serious look at Flutter. ",

Bottlenecks to omnipresent AI, such as power consumption, bandwidth, latency, network connectivity, security and privacy have led to recent innovations in on-device edge computing for AI.</p><p>Gartner projects that IoT devices will climb to a total of 50 billion by 2020 and the market is expected to grow from USD 185.8 Million in 2017 to USD 838.6 Million by 2022, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 35.2%, unleashing a wave of services and applications at the network edge that can be optimized with artificial intelligence.</p><p>Today, in most cases, IoT and AI work together in cloud computing. Data from IoT devices is transmitted back to a central hub in the cloud where it is analyzed and stored and actionable insights are sent back to the device. In this session, we will discuss some real-life use-cases of performing AI on edge and its importance; followed by the challenges of the presently used approaches in terms of latency, network connectivity, privacy, cost, etc and its possible solutions. Few of the use cases for edge AI includes healthcare, smart security cameras, UAVs, ADAS, mobility, etc.</p><p>In this talk, I will discuss the ways to train AI models in the cloud and to move the existing AI applications from the cloud to the edge for deployment. I will be showcasing demos of deploying edge applications using the Neural Compute Stick (NCS) which is a tiny, fan-less, very low-power, low-cost deep learning device that can be used to perform AI at the edge. I will also provide a brief overview of free Open source software (like OpenVINO) that helps developers speed up computer vision workloads, streamline deep learning inference and deployments and enable easy, heterogeneous execution across from cloud to edge platforms. It enables to write AI applications once and run everywhere.</p>",

Well that's not the case, every product is different and needs lot of customisation to make OS fit for end consumer. Air conditioner don't need to run audio files so why not remove ALSA subsystem and save some space/resources?</p><p></p><p>Building a custom Linux image for embedded products is not easy , especially when you need an entire rootfs with thousands of packages on top of a kernel.

A CI pipeline is an essential tool for any modern development team, as the necessary quality assurance mechanism that ensures they can deliver working software. Slow, (or, worse, broken) pipelines cause serious impediment to development teams, and this impediment directly translates into wasted $$$. </p><p></p><p>Instead, CI should be very much treated like any other production system the company maintains. Whereas the customer-facing systems bring revenue into the company, the CI pipeline ensures the development teams remain productive and efficient in serving the former. </p><p></p><p>From this talk, you can expect to pick up some tips on how to speed up your CI pipelines -  leveraging cloud capabilities, such as horizontal scaling of its workloads to cater for more / heavier /longer builds. This leads to short feedback loops in the development cycle, and - therefore - a more efficient use of your dev team’s (expensive) time.  And for the cherry on top,  you will probably be reducing your CI costs while doing all this!</p>",

With the \ndevelopment of these machines there has been open source tooling \ndeveloped to use them. One such example is QISKit, which is an Apache \nLicensed SDK for developing quantum applications. It lets you mix \nclassical programming and quantum computing together to build \napplications that leverage the advantages of both.\n\nThis workshop will explain the basics of quantum information theory and \nhow you build quantum circuits. It will then provide a hands on \nintroduction into using qiskit and how you can use it to implement \nquantum programs, how that can be integrated together within a larger \napplication, and will also demonstrate how you can run your quantum \nprogram on real quantum computers.</p>",

This will not just unleash the power but, these tricks will help audience to learn new things about kubectl which will improve there productivity with kubectl. Talk will involve things like how you can set editor of your choice for kubectl, how to learn about kubernetes resources using kubectl only and lot more cool stuff.

Openness alone is nothing but once connected with grassroots awareness and civic technology, it’s everything especially for the developing countries like Nepal. Slowly and steadily, Nepal is making a significant improvement in the field of openness and the use of civic technology to tackle development challenges has been a great case study which can help many others developing countries.

        "short_abstract": "Targeted audience are managers, system architects, system administrators and developers of Linux systems in small to enterprise sized environments. Networked Linux machines more and more take over tasks formerly executed by Mainframe systems. With those tasks also comes the workload which has to be managed and automated. New technologies like Business Intelligence, Data Warehousing and Big Data also require the execution of numerous programs interconnected by dependencies and synchronization needs. To manage those workloads, the use of Enterprise Job Scheduling or Workload Automation systems is self-evident in Mainframe environments for decades. In Linux environments this software class is not widely spread and automation is done using cron, built in scheduling functionality of systems like ETL tools and a bunch of scripts. This creates a numerous amount of problems regarding transparency, maintainability, stability and efficiency. One reason for this development was the lack of an Open Source Workload Automation System able to satisfy the demands. Since 2013 the schedulix Open Source Enterprise Job Scheduling System closes this gap and gives an extremely powerful and reliable tool into the hands of Linux system administrators and software developers. The other reason is the lack of knowledge on this software class and which huge benefits job scheduling systems can deliver. This talk is aimed to change this and to give the audience an introduction to what schedulix can do to establish an efficient, reliable and cost effective IT Workload Automation.",

Only rendering the part the user wants to see can provide huge performance gains. Windowing is rendering just enough content to fill the screen and continuously updating the DOM as the user scrolls. In this talk, participants will learn how windowing works and how to implement basic windowing in their code from scratch. We will discuss some use cases for windowing and explore some windowing libraries like react-window, react virtualized and virtual-scroller.</p><p><b style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></b></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><b>Outline:</b></span></p><ol style=\"\"><li style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\"><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">The problem: rendering large no. of nodes slows down the page (rendering process).</span></p></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\"><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">Use Cases (Demo): Large Tables, chat, contact list.</span></p></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\"><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">Windowing: how it works</span></p></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\"><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">Demo: with windowing</span></p></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\"><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">How to implement windowing (basic version)</span></p></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\"><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">Discussing Windowing libraries: virtual scroller, react virtualize, react window etc.</span></p></li></ol><p><b style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></b></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><b>Requirements:</b></span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">Web &amp; Javascript knowledge.</span></p>",

That pitch hasn't always easy. It may not even work in some industries. However, to take open source into future, we will all need it as a critical part of our repertoire.   </p><p>Whether its pitching investors, getting your company to invest in a program office or convincing your manager to make open source part of your job, we could all do a better job of crafting compelling and coherent narratives for how to translate open source into business value and revenue potential. As more and more mainstream companies begin to understand and invest in open source, we'll need the tools and concepts to help capitalize on these opportunities. </p><p>Drawing from pitches to VCs, investors and board rooms, this talk explores themes and strategies for how to find and improve your voice and personal narrative to make open source an essential part of your growth trajectory. We'll also hear a number of war stories from perspective of engineers and program managers at large companies about how they effectively sold open source within their organizations. </p>",

The talk put forwards a model for a Blockchain based application for e-Governance. It was structured with respect to a use-case scenario which depicts how government offices in Kerala work. Like Switzerland and some other countries, the procedures and paper work that has to be carried out is really tiresome. Hence itself there are chances for many problems such as inconsistent data on different documents, the hoarding of documents by the evil employee and many more. This makes peoples life more harder.  </p><p><u><b>Use-Case Scenario</b></u></p><p>This is based on a real life scenario. Consider a college student submitting a proposal for an event at the college to a professor who is the head of the club. The head verifies the request and add comments to it. If everything is OK then he/she signs it and forwards it to the academic council which will verify the document based on several other factors like the available free days, the budget allocated etc. After all is well and good the documents are signed and forwarded to the principal of the college. Similar procedures are carried out again and the submitted proposal is accepted and permission to conduct the event is granted.</p><p></p><p>From a integrity point of view there are many point during the course starting from submission to acceptance that is susceptible to problems like document hoarding and other malpractices. <b></b><u><b></b></u></p><p>This could be solved using Blockchain.

Learning the lessons from the \nhistory of developing classical computers, there are already several \nopen source SDKs, languages, and libraries being developed for \nquantum computers despite the current limitations of quantum computers. \nThis means as the technology matures and becomes more practical there \nwill already be an open source ecosystem for using quantum computing.\n\n</p><p></p><p>This talk will provide an introduction to the basics of quantum \ninformation theory, look at some of the quantum computers out there, \nexplore the open source tooling available for quantum computing, and \nshow how you can use that to write your own quantum programs and run \nthem on simulators and actual quantum computers.</p>",

On par with the developments in technology, many threats to information security have emerged that can impact sensitive transactions: intruders can easily cause all kinds of breaches and crash networks, launch denial of service attacks, inject malware, and so on. To avoid such breaches, security administrators badly need a means to detect intruders and prevent them from entering the network. Nowadays, new threats and associated solutions are emerging together.</i></p><p style=\"\"><i>This session showcases a hybrid intrusion detection system that leverages the benefits of machine learning techniques to build a system that detects intrusion and alerts network administrators.

There is a need to rethink privacy in the age of AI. Simply anonymizing data doesn't ensure privacy.</p><p>One of the proposed techniques to improve privacy is differential privacy. Differential privacy provides a mathematical guarantee that your privacy won’t be violated even if your data is used for analysis/ training. It allows the analysis while protecting sensitive data and can be used to maximize accuracy while minimizing the risk.</p><p>In this talk, we will discuss the pros and cons of differential privacy from a machine learning and deep learning perspective and the determination of the optimal balance between accuracy and privacy.</p>",

        "short_abstract": "<p>GO-FOOD, our food delivery product is one of the largest food delivery products in the world. We operate at a massive scale and do a good portion of our overall GO-JEK monthly orders of a 100+ million via GO-FOOD. With 300K+ merchants, there is not only a huge variety for customers to choose from but the discovery of restaurants becomes a challenge. There was a need for improving the search experience of the user so that they can find their favorite merchants quicker, rather than to scroll through pages trying to find them. The idea of Butler was to customize the search results so as to take into account the past order history and preferred cuisines of the user. We wanted to essentially improve our Click Through Rate(percentage of merchant page visits per search sessions) and Booking Conversion Rate(percentage of search sessions that result in a booking). In this talk, we will cover the current architecture for GO-FOOD search, how we personalized the search experience through Butler and how we trained our model by collecting feedback from search results.</p><p>\n\n<b>The architecture of GO-FOOD Search</b>\n\n</p>\n<p>GO-FOOD Search architecture is a combination of Elasticsearch and Postgres. We use Elasticsearch for search and ranking of the merchants and Postgres serves as the source of truth for getting merchant details. For each search request, we first query Elasticsearch which ranks the merchants according to the search query. The search query mostly takes into account that the merchant is open and takes into account the distance from the user for the ranking. After fetching the restaurant details from Elasticsearch, we query Postgres for getting merchant details. The returned response is a combination of Elasticsearch and Postgres response.</p><p><b>Coming up with Search Personalization Architecture</b></p><p>When tasked with personalizing search results, we had to first analyze how to come up with the following: a. Fetching customer information like favorite merchants, favorite cuisine information and taking it into account for ranking merchants b. Creating a Learning To Rank model that can be used for ranking merchants</p>\n<p>a. Fetching Customer Preference Information We have an internal batch processing product named Tagstore/Tagstream which populates customer data with information about his past order history and browsing history. It also takes into account the cuisine and merchant information for which he ordered in the last 1 month and 6 months. This data is updated on a daily basis and fetching this data was just a lookup to retrieve customer information and use it to personalize the search results.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>b. Creating a learning model While analyzing our options for using a model to rank the restaurants, we found that a plugin called LearnToRank(LTR) using which we can use a learning to rank model against our searches. The initial model took into account features that capture customer-merchant browsing and ordering interactions along with the distance between the merchant and customer . A relevance by query dataset that summarizes the judgement a user made on each search listing was prepared and an LTR model that was trained using <span>Ranklib</span>.<span> </span></p>\n<p>Ranklib offers a suite of ML algorithms that can be used to train ranking models. The algorithm that we chose for initial experimentation was LambdaMART given that we wanted initial iterations of the model to be as interpretable as possible while using state of the art LTR models.</p>\n<p>The LambdaMART algorithm learns an ensemble of regression trees that work over each of the features given to it and maps each merchant-customer combination to one of the tree nodes along with the boost in score that should be attributed to that search listing so as to maximize a ranking quality metric. The non discounted cumulative gain(nDCG) metric computes the quality of each search result depending on the ranking positions at which the clicks and bookings occured in comparison to the best possible search ranking that could have been presented to the user.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Personalizing Search Results with Butler </b></p>\n<p>Butler is a golang app that serves as the endpoint for serving the search results from elasticsearch. With every search request, we take into account the customer id, customer location and tile that the user has selected(Example: nearby restaurants, restaurants which are open 24*7, best selling merchants etc). For personalizing the elasticsearch response, we first fetch the customer details from the tagstore that we discussed previously. After this we pass in the customer preference information as a parameter to the model in the search query. The model is used to rescore the elasticsearch documents and we get personalized response for a user’s search request. When rolling out personalized search, we made sure that we roll it out only to a certain percentage of the search traffic. So we created a rollout end point for each tile, so that we can first test the personalized results for a particular tile and compare the results. Since user trends vary across different tiles, rolling it out to different tiles and measuring the non personalized vs personalized results made more sense. We also created a live dashboard that shows the booking conversion and search click conversion. Using this we were able to track how our personalized search performed against our traditional search.</p><p><b>Creating a Feedback cycle to train model from Search Results </b></p>\n<p>As part of our initial efforts, we were just tracking the SLAs, booking and search click conversions. We were not tracking the scores that LTR provides to each restaurant by considering the customer profile information. We realized that this was very vital information to train the current model. In Order to collect these metrics, we enabled LTR metric logging in the search query. After collecting the LTR metrics, we push these metrics along with the customer information to kafka.</p>\n<p>From kafka, we have cold storage pipeline setup which pushes the kafka data to GCS. The search data as well the positions at which the user clicked and made bookings from is pushed to GCS via kafka as well. These data sources are used now to create the judgement dataset that can act as the training data for the next iteration of the LTR model.</p><p></p>\n<p><b>Next steps with Search Personalization </b></p><p><b></b>As an improvement to the search personalization experience, we want to improve the model performance by taking into account more information about customer-merchant interaction. For example we want to use take into account the primary cuisine information of the merchant so that when users search for the cuisine we can prioritize the merchant. From a technical point of view, we want the ability to run multiple learning models at the same time and compare the results from the various experiments.</p>",

        "short_abstract": "<p>BASIC INTRODUCTION OF TERRAFORM</p><p>The elasticity and scalability of the cloud provides lots of opportunity\nfor automation. Some automation tools and services are provided by cloud\nvendors themselves. But all those services come with vendor lock: they’ll only\ndeploy within their own environments.</p><p>BENEFIT OF USING TERRAFORM</p><p>Build your entire Huawei Cloud Family infrastructure with one command.\nServers, network, storage, DNS, CDNs, load balancers, and much more all have\nAPIs. Terraform is a tool to model all of these resources in a single language\nacross multiple cloud providers, then bring then up and connect them all in a\nsingle command. Terraform can then be used to model changes to your Huawei\ninfrastructure and safely effect those changes. Terraforms safety comes from\nthe ability to \"plan\" changes: Terraform shows you an execution plan\nof what it will do before it does it. You can then determine if a change is\nsafe or not and whether to apply it. Along with this safety Terraform is highly\nresistant to errors: it retries failed operations and is idempotent and can be\nrun again if an operation cannot complete the first time. In this talk we\npresent the problems faced in automating infrastructure and how Terraform is\nbeing used to solve them in production.</p><p> </p><p>USE CASES:</p><p>•             Orchestrate and\nOptimize multi-cloud/tier deployments on OpenStack Clouds using Opensource\ntechnology-Terraform</p><p>Terraform is meant to help you combine all the components you’ll need to\nbuild and launch your application infrastructure. It's often attractive to\nspread infrastructure across multiple clouds to increase fault-tolerance. By\nusing only a single region or cloud provider, fault tolerance is limited by the\navailability of that provider. Having a multi-cloud deployment allows for more\ngraceful recovery of the loss of a region or entire provider.</p><p> </p><p>Realizing multi-cloud deployments can be very challenging as many\nexisting tools for infrastructure management are cloud-specific. Terraform is\ncloud-agnostic and allows a single configuration to be used to manage multiple\nproviders, and to even handle cross-cloud dependencies. This simplifies\nmanagement and orchestration, helping operators build large-scale multi-cloud\ninfrastructures.</p><p> </p><p>You could, for instance, select a base server from Huawei Cloud, DNS\nfrom Open Telekom Cloud, and a Postgres database from Telefonica Open Cloud.\nTerraform will build a single application framework from across all these\nproviders in parallel.</p><p> </p><p>A very common pattern is the N-tier architecture. The most common 2-tier\narchitecture is a pool of web servers that use a database tier.</p><p>Terraform is an ideal tool for building and managing these infrastructures.\nEach tier can be described as a collection of resources, and the dependencies\nbetween each tier are handled automatically; Terraform will ensure the database\ntier is available before the web servers are started and that the load\nbalancers are aware of the web nodes. Each tier can then be scaled easily using\nTerraform by modifying a single count configuration value. Because the creation\nand provisioning of a resource is codified and automated, elastically scaling\nwith load becomes trivial.</p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p> </p>",

So how can people make sure that the application they are using is secure and their data is not vulnerable? Well, Reverse engineering is the answer to these worries as it is the only way to get the code that made up the application. In this session, I aim to provide a brief info on what reverse engineering actually is and then will dive into exploring the basic tools that are required for the purpose of reverse engineering an Android app and lastly, we will explore the wonders of Reverse Engineering by using handful of tools to exploit the code base of a functional Android application.",

Weather forecasts, financial research, stock market data, sales data, medical research -- all of these have seen applications of automated narratives. Recent research includes an experiment which showed that users sometimes preferred computer-generated weather forecasts to human-written ones, in part because the computer forecasts used more consistent terminology.</p><p>This talk shares some of the successful examples of natural language generation, the techniques and libraries behind these, and how you can incorporate narratives into your data analysis.</p>",

Here I'll talk about the framework behind a conversational agent starting with how NLP concepts are used to decipher users intent from a sentence by using dependency parsing, categorizing various parts of speech, recognizing named entities, followed by an explanation of each of these concepts. Further I'll touch upon how knowledge graphs play an important role in conversational agents, and how they are used for entity disambiguation. Lastly, I'll talk about the various tools and frameworks available for building conversational agents.

There is also a lack of official sign language interpreters. In India the official number of certified sign language interpreters stood at merely 250 in the year 2017. This makes communication with mute people really difficult. Most of the teaching methods for deaf and dumb involve accommodating them to people without disabilities - while discouraging the sign language.  To make it easier for people to communicate with deaf and dumb people, I had attempted to use tensorflow to interpret sign language. As of now the system can recognize only alphabets and work is in progress to interpret complete words. The talk will be divide in two parts. First is how tensorflow object recognition was used to achieve the desired results. The second part will focus on how to contribute to the project and add localization (language specific signs) to make it more robust and more usable.</p>",

During the Google Summer of Code 2018, we had a number of new features and enhancements made to the SUSI server and clients. The most important part of the <a href=\"http://SUSI.AI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">SUSI.AI</a> project is its skills. We aim to provide quality user experience through the skills that we have. And, to develop and improve upon the existing skills, we needed reviews and feedback from the user. Hence, a new skill rating and feedback system have been developed which allows the users to rate the skills using a five-star rating system and also provides them with a section where they can add their feedback. In case, they find any skill inappropriate, they can also report the skill. The skill rating and feedback system serve as a channel through which we get to know the needs and expectations of our users, which in turn adds to our motivation to consistently improve upon the existing skills.</p><p>Along with these new features, the clients have a new UI and the skills have been organised in a better way to provide faster access to more useful skills as per the need of the user. Also, the skills load 10x faster than they used to. A number of features, like changing the skill language, addition of more languages, etc., have been added to the web and Android/iOS clients to provide a more personalised experience to the user.</p><p>I would discuss all of the above features that I have worked on during my GSoC this year and would discuss its implementation and the technologies that have been used. I would also demonstrate how the users can help us improve the SUSI skills by providing their constructive feedback. I would also try to motivate people to contribute to our projects and help us build more robust skills that can give better responses because the intelligence of <a href=\"http://SUSI.AI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">SUSI.AI</a> lies with SUSI skills.</p>",

Based on these issues I decided to build a prototype that can solve these<b><i> real time issues</i></b>.</p><p><b>Idea :</b> Using <i>IoT</i> based devices a simplified architecture is made to define geological and geographical conditions of a farm(agricultural field). Based on the<i> real time sensor feedback and comparing it with preexisting weather data and present records,</i> the crops can be predicted for a given farm with adequate nutrition requirements and optimal growth conditions. The recorded data can be sent to cloud for observation(Android app).</p><p><b style=\"\">Prototype and Process </b><b style=\"\">:</b>The whole hardware setup has a box kind of model with some soil inside it for growing a crop. The geological conditions(physical) of soil can be measured using pressure and moisture probes by placing them inside the soil and the geographical conditions(atmospheric) such as temperature, humidity pressure and gases(nitrogen and Oxygen) required by the crop for growing well can be measured using temperature and gas sensors that are connected to the box in such a way that it forms a medium between external atmospheric conditions and soil. The whole data measured by the sensors can be operated and processed in a <i>raspberry-pi(</i>this series connection of sensors to raspberry-pi can be given using an<i> Arduino nano or an I2C)</i>, then finally the processed data like temperature, moisture and pressure in the soil can be specifically seen in an Android app where the whole info from raspberry-pi is sent to cloud.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b> : This device will help the farmers and cultivators in different village to grow crops with suitable soil.</p><p><i>pressure humidity sensors:</i> BME 280 sensors </p><p><i>gases measuring sensors:</i> MQ series sensors depending upon the gas in atmosphere.  EX: MQ 4 for methane and MQ 7 for CO </p><p>soil moisture and pressure monitoring module - 12 v (135636)</p><p>Raspberry-pi to cloud medium - <i>cayenne IoT software</i> </p><p><i style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Applications :  </i>1. This device can be used by farmers and cultivators to know the soil suitable for growing a crop in villages.</p><p>2.

Though baseline achieving i18n remains the same, it has various implementations. For example implementation of the most famous i18n framework gettext spans C/C++, Python, PHP, Java, JS, .NET and many others. Web development frameworks (like Django, Spring, Rails, Drupal, etc.) may have their own method. Some keep their language resources in PO (gettext portable object) format, others in JSON, YML, INI, RESX, PROPERTIES etc. i18n methods are being evaluated and enhanced which results in multilingual web pages getting much popularity.</p><p></p><p>Modern web applications include various frameworks mixedup, which actually takes i18n into more complex level. For example Angular UI with Django as backend code. This session shall try to demystify full-stack i18n/l10n with an example of angular-django application. Outine would be (1) introduction to gettext i18n (2) i18n/l10n steps (3) demo (4) manage translations. So, if you are building or planning to build your idea in Django (or in any other framework) lets discuss how we can achieve i18n/l10n for the stack.</p>",

But, we don’t start off that way. We start off as curious infants with an instinct for self-preservation. But, then we quickly realise over the next three to four years that there is a better way that is more fun, collaborative, imaginative and more innovative and we learn to work together. As we grow up, we learn to be competitive and ultimately we become exposed to the problems that affect our lives on a daily basis, be it the health-related issues, education-related issues or even lifestyle-related issues and we all have a connected curiosity to find solutions to our shared struggles. We have all witnessed the magnitude of change that technology has brought into our lives, over the last 20 years. Join me to know how this connected curiosity brings together amazing developers to solve the world’s problems with technology as a tool.</span></p>",

MySQL is world's most popular open source database and caching the data has always been a very interesting problem involving database usage design. Using cache instead of fetching from disk makes the response time time exponentially fast. In this swift world with manifold use cases for software, there are use cases of intelligent caching. This involves pre polluting the cache directly from data source before cached data is requested from Redis. Pre population of cache can be done as follows based on use case:</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">- pre populate the cache before starting application.</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">  This makes the application faster from beginning as required data is already cached.</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">- populate a set of key, value once a key matching a pattern is set in cache</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">  This case is based on sequential multiple disk access as application is executed. When a key is populated in disk, the probability of other related keys increases. </span><span style=\"\">For example, if when a user logged in the website, the changes of him accessing his profile increases. The use case is more significant in different scenario.</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">- Never let a cache expire</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">  Set a key/pattern of keys to a group which will always be present in the cache. If it is deleted from cache, it will be fetched from the data source and cache will be auto populated.</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">  This case fits best for the keys which are frequently used buy frequently expires too.</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">The talk will comprehensively discuss above scenarios with MySQL plugin for redistribution caching, showing the improvement with the smart caching and how to integrate it in some of the applications.</span></p><p><span style=\"\"></span></p>",

The algorithm was built as part of my Master thesis work with Ericsson Cloud Research at Stockholm, Sweden.  </p><p>We designed and developed a mechanism that enables search for nodes in a P2P system based on their geographic location. For a P2P node, the mechanism builds and maintains a distributed search index. We introduce a bootstrapping protocol, NSBootstrap, which builds this search index for a P2P node.We also introduce a lookup protocol that utilizes this index, NSSearch. The mechanism has been tested on an emulated P2P environment with up to 3000 nodes. The evaluation suggests that the state maintained on a node grows logarithmically with N, the total number of P2P nodes in the system. Additionally, a new node joining the P2P system requires log (N) steps to converge through our mechanism. Additionally, a valid search query within the scope of the search index is completed with log (N) steps.</p>",

As a result, I used an app, geniebook, an online tuition service to help me improve.

We wanted to create an app like geniebook, but one that could mark questions faster and more efficiently.</p><p style=\"\">Sciencer consists of an interface for sudents to take tests and an interface for teachers to add questions, tests as well as mark answers disputed by the students.

It allows students to practice for Science exams multiple times and recieve marks immediately.</p><p style=\"\">Sciencer has been designed so even non-technical teachers can add in questions and tests easily.
